For this Product I'll be creating a CRUD application that allows users to CREATE a post with a link to a video(if logged in), READ comments on posts, and UPDATE/DELETE a comment. 

the USER STORY of this web app is going to be very familiar as almost all social media apps are made up of these same CRUD properties. it will be much like the user experience of Instagram

-Landing/Index page will display posts which will be links to slam footage.

- users will be able to create posts but will be prompted to log in with Google before being able to post.

-users will have the option to add comments to any post once loged in which will redirect them to the comment section/page. 

-users will be able to update or delete their comments only when in the comment section of any post.

INSTASLAM is made up of HTML, CSS, javaScript, Nodejs, express, and mongoose.

down the road id reallu love to cut the middle man and be able to render the videos on site instead of redirecting users to other pages.

Below is a link to the GitHub Repo that includes my HTML, CSS, javaScript:
